## '>>hello world.'

The game that I have been designing is called >>hello world. It is a 2D top-down game, and the core mechanic is the use of electricity and electromagnetism to manipulate the environment. 

### Astra

Astra is the player character in >>hello world. They are a robot, and the machinery of one of their arms is exposed, which means that they can attack using electricity.

### Angel

She was once a human but has now cybernetically enhanced her body and her mind so much that she is no longer human. She attacks the player using her tentacles and also electricity." }

Angel is the final boss in >>hello world. She was once a human but has now cybernetically enhanced her body and her mind so much that she is no longer human. She attacks the player using her tentacles and also electricity. She went through a lot of iterations, because I couldn't figure out what kind of boss I wanted her to be. However, I am very proud of her character design now.

### Ray

He attacks the player using Shockers, which is one of the minor enemies that the player fights, so the mechanics of the boss will not be entirely unfamiliar to the player." }

### Environment design of '>>hello world'

'>>hello world' is set in a city (called Crater City) that is underwater and under a dome. The bottom half of Crater City has no natural light and the top half does, but not much.

### Unused final boss of '>>hello world.'

## The Mortality Brothers

The Mortality Brothers are some characters that I made. they are twin brothers, and one of them has power over life, while the other has power over death. I wanted their designs to look like they are somewhat similar to each other, but also different.
